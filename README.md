# Deep Learning with Python

This repository stores:

1. Learning resources

The `second_edition` folder stores Jupyter notebooks implementing the code samples found in the book [Deep Learning with Python, 2nd Edition (Manning Publications)](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python-second-edition?a_aid=keras&a_bid=76564dff)

2. Exercises

The `exercises` folder stores homework problems assigned by Dr. Jihun Hamm at Tulane University for the Deep Learning class.

3. Fun projects

Learning isn't concrete until the theory is carried on to solve real problems. I will use `kaggle` as a reference and practice solving real life questions with Deep Learning techniques and document my studies in `fun_project` folder.
